# Welcome to this page that documents the differences between Azure and AWS

Azure and AWS are 2 of the big 3 in regards to cloud providers (GCP being the 3rd). This document provides some differences between Azure and AWS.

#### One of the default security group rules is to allow any traffic on any port within your virtual network. All devices on the inside of your virtual network can talk to each other, regardless of if they're on the same subnet or not.

#### Azure specifies what instance you're in on the gitbash, different to AWS

#### AWS is much faster in starting and stopping instances

#### AWS does not open any ports inherently, much safer than Azure

#### Azure provides disclaimers when your ports are accessible to anyone

#### Azure recommends Azure CLI to complete tasks
