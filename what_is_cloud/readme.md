# The Cloud
## What is cloud computing? 
Cloud computing is the process of using computers or computing resources (such as servers) over the internet, as opposed to locally.
## How do we know if something is in the cloud? Differences between on-prem and the cloud?
You can determine whether something is on-prem or in the cloud through how you access it. For example, if a server is accessed through the server room in a company building, then it is on-prem. Companies have began to host servers on the cloud as this runs cheaper, hence more beneficial for the Business. This would be an instance of cloud storage.
<br>
'On-prem' aka on premise is when software is installed and runs on a company's own hardware infrastructure, whilst hosted locally.
<br>
Cloud software is stored on the provider's servers and accessed through other means, such as a web browser.
## The 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud - Differences? How do they work?
![img.png](img.png)

- Private cloud:
  - Owned and operated by a single organisation.
  - Only internal users or authorised external users can access resources.
  - High security.
- Public cloud:
  - Owned and operated by third-party providers.
  - Accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
  - Low security.
- Hybrid cloud:
  - Combines private and public environments.
  - Interopability and flexibility allow efficiency and versatility.
  - Differing range of security based on what data is being accessed.
- Multi-cloud:
  - Multiple public cloud providers used to host different services.
  - Helps organisations reduce risks with service outages.
  - Adopted by organisations looking to maximise cloud services from multiple providers.
## Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS - What are differences?
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
- Iaas = Infrastructure as a Service:
  - Provides computing resources over the internet, allowing users to rent components such as storage and virtual machines.
- PaaS = Platform as a Service:
  - Provides a development and deployment environment in the cloud, including tools to build, deploy and manage applications.
- SaaS = Software as a Service:
  - Provides software applications over the internet, allowing users to use services without having to manage it.

## What are the advantages/disadvantages of the cloud? (Particularly for a business)
![img_3.png](img_3.png)
Advantages of the cloud:
- Low cost
- Accessibility
- Scalability
- Disaster recovery

Disadvantages of the cloud:
- Security concerns
- Downtime potential
- Data privacy and compliance
- Limited control

## Difference between OpEx vs CapEx and how it relates the cloud
OpEx = Operating Expenses
<br>
CapEx = Capital Expenses
<br>
<br>
OpEx are the day-to-day expenses a business incurs due to the ongoing operations.
<br>
<br>
CapEx are investments in assets that provide benefits over multiple accounting periods.
<br> <br>
This relates to the cloud as cloud services are primarily OpEx. However, if a business decides to build their own private cloud infrastructure, this would be a CapEx investment.
## Is migrating to the cloud always cheaper?
Migrating to the cloud is not always cheaper, as it depends on the business.
<br>
For example, a legacy system may incur significant costs when migrating to the cloud, hence it would be more cost-efficient to remain local. 
## Marketshare - What is the breakdown? Add a diagram to help understand marketshare trends
![img_4.png](img_4.png)
Market share is the percent of total sales in an industry, that is generated by a particular company.
## What are the 3 largest Cloud providers known for (What makes them popular? What are some of their USPs?)
AWS, Azure and GCP are the 3 largest Cloud providers. They account for 66% of the worldwide cloud infrastructure market.
<br> <br>
They benefitted from early investment, as AWS launched its services in 2006. Azure and GCP followed shortly, hence leading to the dominant market share. <br>
The global reach of the 3 allow them to deploy applications close to users, thus reducing latency and increasing efficiency.
## Which cloud provider do you think might be the best? Why?
I believe AWS is the best cloud provider due to the ability for configurability that AWS provides. The AWS APIs are also superior, hence the reason for why I believe AWS is the best cloud provider.
## What sorts of things do you usually need to pay for when using the cloud?
The costs of cloud computing are:
- Networking costs
- Storage costs
- Computing costs
## What are the 4 pillars of DevOps? How do they link into the Cloud?
The four pillars of DevOps are:
- Communication
- Collaboration
- Automation
- Monitoring
<br> <br>
The 4 pillars of DevOps link into the cloud as the synergy allows developers to focus on development and testing, whilst being unburdened by infrastructure concerns.
